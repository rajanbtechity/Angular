1. In the con fusion project, when no dish is selected, footer is right below the dish list. But when a dish is selected 
footer shifts down and  we have dish details being displayed  between dish list and footer. Try to find what all parameters
cotribute to achieve this re adjustment of the screen.

2.
@NgModule({
  declarations: [],
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes)
  ],
  exports: [ RouterModule ]
})

Notice the export in app-routing.module. This exports makes RouterModule available to AppModule. 
If we don't add this export in app-routing.module then we need to explicitly import RouterModule in app.module.ts. 

import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
